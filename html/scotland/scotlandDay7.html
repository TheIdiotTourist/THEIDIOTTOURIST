    <h2 class="text-center font-weight-bold"><u>DAY 7 – THURSO</u></h2>

    <p>Dragging our bags back to the train station we passed over the River Ness a final time. I limped my way up the street to a mall beside the station. We hoped to find a pharmacy to purchase a knee brace. With only a short time before the train arrived
        we decided to leave empty handed. Returning to the station we boarded with familiarity.</p>

    <p>Four hours of rails took us through the highlands, past farmlands with hillsides of ever increasing heights. Pastures hosting sheep, deer and cows. Lochs expanding towards mountainous geography. Small town stations gradually shrank to single platforms
        near country roads the further north we traveled. Fences kept animals away from the tracks, herding them towards steeply inclined pastures.</p>

    <p>The hours to Thurso allowed my knee time to heal. Limping a little less on the way to our next hotel. Fortunately Pentland Hotel was only blocks away from the train station. Another old, stone building with a quiet flower garden at one side. A park
        across the street spanned a city block. Branches from a tree in the neighboring churchyard reached across our window. A flock of crows nested among the limbs, vocalizing their presence intermittently. More kindred spirits from Jasmine and her
        mother. We dropped our bags and left to explore Thurso.</p>

    <p>Compared to the streets in the larger cities Thurso almost appeared uninhabited. Just a small, sleepy, seaside town. Arriving between lunch and dinner shifts left us short of food options. We managed to find a pub with an open kitchen and looked over
        the menu. I wanted to try a Scottish venison burger. It came topped with fried haggis and onion rings. My stomach disagreed with my choice.</p>

    <p>We left the pub and found our way to the beach. The Atlantic met coastline in the shape of a half moon. To the left were alcoves carved into the cliffside by the surf, the ruins of Thurso Castle on the opposite shore. Far off in the horizon an image
        of the Orkney Isle’s wavering in the mist rose above the waves. Anticipating our voyage the next day I stepped closer to the ocean allowing the waves to reach my boots.</p>

    <p>Waves crashed playfully along an alcove at one end of the beach. Kelp floated rhythmically in sync among rocky tide pools . Climbing atop the rocks I could see the small port town of Scrabster in the distance. There we would catch our ferry across
        to Orkney the following morning. Walking back through the park above the seaside cliffs brought us to one of Thurso’s main streets. Heading back to the hotel enjoying the architecture of the town with the ocean backdrop. My mother and sister opted
        to visit a grocery store while I returned to our room to rest my knee.</p>

    <p>The grocery team returned to the room with ice for my knee and light snacks for the evening. We ate grapes and cheese while I iced my aching ligaments. Spotty internet connection kept our conversation with our loved ones back home brief. Wanting extra
        rest anyway we headed to bed. My sister and mother took the two beds in the main room while I had the connected children’s room to myself. Complete with crib or bunk bed for sleeping options. I chose bottom bunk fearing my weight might cause a
        top-heavy frame to land me in the crib. We all needed our rest, the next day demanded travel endurance.</p>
