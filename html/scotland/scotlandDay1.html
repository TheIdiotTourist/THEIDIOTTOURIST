    <u>DAY 1 – LOUISVILLE TO GLASGOW</u></h2>

<p>The first day of any expedition is fraught with a mixture of anxiety and excitement. A truth for my first international excursion. Most of my anxieties concerned the unlikely event of the plane dropping from the sky into the ocean. There was also separation
    anxiety about leaving my girlfriend Jasmine. It was my first time away from her since she had moved in a few months prior. With the only car and license between the two of us I was Jasmine’s main source of transportation in those months. We made multiple
    attempts to obtain her license before I left but remained unsuccessful. Our last attempt fell on the day prior to leaving. This raised our joint concerns about my absence. Fortunately my father; Glendon, kind heartedly offered to help Jasmine with
    the commutes while I was away.</p>

<p>Graced by the company of friends at a cook out the same night also helped ease some tension. We celebrated into the late evening with food and drink. Jasmine and I tried to remain awake until my parents arrived to pick me up before dawn. I was attempting
    to reduce jet lag by avoiding sleep until arriving in Edinburgh. However, we slept for about an hour and awoke at three-thirty to my parents knocking on the kitchen door. Jasmine and I quickly grabbed my bags and dashed to the car. Our party arrived
    at the airport five minutes later, departing with hugs and kisses before walking into the building to begin our day of air travel.</p>

<p>No trip is without a bit of tribulation, we encountered some within minutes. Our flights routed through New York City, then Toronto, followed by a fuel stop in Halifax before finally crossing the Atlantic to Glasgow. The flight was through an affiliate
    of a major airline and we had trouble finding the correct ticket gate. Mom stood in line waiting for what she thought was the proper airline to open at four. I decided to check the giant television screens displaying itineraries. There was only one
    flight to JFK leaving at our specified time through Delta. Their line already growing at their open ticket counter downstairs and across the airport from where my mother waited. By the time I got back upstairs, there was only a few minutes before
    the employees where scheduled to arrive. She wanted to wait before abandoning the line, so we did. Arriving directly at four they opened services once they were comfortably settled. Impatience arose from anxiety and continued Festering when the agent
    couldn’t confirm our reservations in their system. They suggested we try Delta, all the way to the left of the building, in the basement, with the growing line.</p>

<p>We gathered our luggage, walking quickly towards Delta. There we stood in line patiently. Scanned our tickets and passports but remained lost in the system. The gentleman suggested we try upstairs at United, the line we just left. Upon returning to the
    desk we told the employee Delta sent us back. Still unable to confirm our reservations still they suggested American Airlines, a few queues to the left. We waited in line until greeted with the same baffled results by their agents. They suggested
    we try Delta since they were the only flight leaving the airport to New York. Downstairs, Delta confirmed they were the only flight that would match our itinerary but our reservations remained nonexistent.</p>

<p>The agent rallied to our cause, calling some internal company number to hopefully amend the situation. With ease he remained on the line while assisting a large military group check into their flight to Thailand. All the while, we stood to the side wondering
    if our trip would actually take place. After the military group efficiently filed into order, our agent told us he still couldn’t confirm our reservations. Making matters worse we probably wouldn’t make it through customs in time even if our names
    miraculously appeared in the system. His final suggestion was to call whatever company we booked the flights through. Hopefully they could fix the mess.</p>

<p>My mother would call the company while I discussed the situation with my father. Both conversations went smoothly. The company redirected our flights to Atlanta, then Orlando and finally to Glasgow. A stop less with an estimated arrival ten minutes earlier
    than our original flight. Crisis averted.</p>

<p>The first flight was free of malfunctions despite my jumpy nerves at every minor bout of turbulence. We landed at Atlanta’s massive airport. Navigating the entangled corridors and levels, we took an interior rail system to our next gate. Then ate lunch
    while waiting to board our flight to Orlando.</p>

<p class="text-wrap"> Another quick flight before arriving to an airport with some sense of familiarity. Memories of a previous trip to Orlando arose as we walked past gates. It was obvious Disney was a high priority trip for Scottish and American families alike. Everyone
    at the gate was returning home while we awaited the proper start to our vacation.</p>

<p class="text-wrap">Our earlier tribulation further transformed into benevolence. Instead of the original single rowed plane, the privilege of a double decker, Virgin Atlantic flight was ours. This came with complimentary meal, movies and goody bag. If not actual first class
    passengers we certainly felt like it, especially with an unused seat between us for extra space on our longest flight. Our musky flight attendant took our order for dinner and returned shortly after to present the food. Mom fell asleep watching a
    western I suggested. I tried to do the same with little success. Turbulence affected the larger aircraft less but travel anxiety left me restless. I would close my eyes, awaken, check the GPS location of the flight, look out the window, reposition
    myself and close my eyes once more. This cycle repeated for hours. Out the window the sun began rising over the ocean below. Shortly after the captain announced our descent into Glasgow. The land below welcomed us with fog hanging heavy above the
    green earth.</p>
