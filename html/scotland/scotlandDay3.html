    <p>Coffee is a morning ritual for me but not for my sister. She didn’t have anything besides instant grounds in the flat. So, instead of my usual two cups and some sort of toast for breakfast, I ended up with a lonely “English” Muffin; just muffin or
        crumpet there. As it crunched between my teeth, the butter and red currant jam dripped from the corners of my mouth, I stood staring out the large windows of my sisters kitchen. The street below was already bustling with tourists and shop keepers
        opening their doors. A coffee shop across the street held my interest, I stared down with a longing for caffeine. As my sister and mother finished preparing for the day out I left the flat in search of a fix. I would meet them on the street below
        the flat after returning with real coffee.</p>

    <p>The small coffee shop across the street was the scene for my next international faux pas. Again, I managed to cross the cobblestones without incurring an incident with oncoming traffic, yet managed to walk past the proper door for the shop. Instead,
        I tried opening a locked door, perhaps leading to the flats above the business. I looked over to the people enjoying their beverages outside on the patio with an embarrassed smirk. I noticed the large, wooden door painted pink beside the couple’s
        table. Making my way past the patio dwellers I mumbled something about doors as I entered. For the sake of ease I just ordered a large coffee with room for cream. The barista rebuked my word choice, revealing they only offered milk. The subtlety
        of cultural difference was easily shaken off until she rang up the order and told me what I owed. I reached in my pocket and pulled out coins to pay. Struggling to make sense of the pounds and pence pieces in my palm the culture shock was palpable.
        A quick glance back up to the barista with my confused, befuddled grin and bleary eyes then back to my hand to make sense of which coins to use. A few more awkward moments before I finally handed over the proper amount and she handed over my coffee
        with some aggravation towards my touristy nature. I left the shop quickly after tipping, hurrying back over to the close where my sister and mother waited for me. I hoped the caffeine would help my brain function so I could avoid any further “Idiot-American-Abroad
        Moments”. Telling them of my incident my sister told me sometimes tips offend since the service industry workers are better paid than their American counter parts. I gulped down my coffee as I took note and followed her and my mother down the
        busy streets.</p>

    <p>My sister need to tend to her laundry, some school work while fighting an allergy attack. So, she would split off from the Arthur’s Seat adventure. She also already made the hike a few months earlier with visiting friends. The long, mostly uphill
        hike just wasn’t appealing to her. So, she provided us with directions, head straight down the Royal Mile past the Palace of Holyroodhouse and then start climbing upwards when you come to giant hillside at the bottom of the mile. We planned to
        find a rain coat and eat brunch before splitting the party for the day. However, before we could decide where to eat the familiar sound of bagpipes and drums filled the air and beckoned us to follow. A kirkyard close by was railed off by police
        officers in fluorescent vests, some directed traffic while others watched the gathering crowd. Inside the barricade stood a regiment of boys and men in full kilt regalia. A band regiment at one end, stood with their drums and bagpipes.</p>

    <p> A police officer explained the occasion to us after we inquired. The Lord High Commissioner was filling in the for the Queen’s inspection of the Boys Brigade. The Boys Brigade shares similarities to the Boy Scouts, the subtle differences are lost
        on me. Then with a call over the radio the officer began preparing people for the Lord High Commissioner’s cavalcade to arrive. Officers split the crowd and opened the barricade as the band quickly tuned and began playing. Bagpipes and drums welcomed
        the string of black limos and official looking vehicles through the crowd into the kirkyard.</p>

    <p>The Lord High Commissioner exited a vehicle with an entourage of pomp and circumstance. He made his rounds of inspection before the band played his entourage into the church. Striking into another song the band then lead the regiment marching up the
        Royal Mile towards the castle. It was all such a strange, unplanned occurrence but quite the serendipitous fortune as mother was ruminating about missing the parade of pipers and drummers at the Highland Games. After the surprise parade we headed
        back down to Princess Street to decide on a coat for my mother since the sky was ever threatening rain.</p>

    <p>Princess Street was bustling with pedestrians and shoppers. We dodged people as we made our way between different department stores and tourist shops. I didn’t do much bargain hunting, I let my mother and sister search for deals while I stayed out
        of the way. Usually, standing at the open door or beneath the awning of whatever shop we were in, watching the people pass amidst intermittent showers.</p>

    <p>Finally a coat was decided on and we searched the streets for a place to eat. Brunch would give the early afternoon showers a chance to subside. We chose a pastry shop nearby. With stomachs filled with breakfast crescents we were prepared to hike
        the largest range of the Edinburgh hills.</p>

    <p>The three of us made our way back to Emily’s flat where she departed our company to attend to her laundry and recuperate from an allergy attack. My mother and I began our trek down the Royal Mile. Walking revealed many of the shops and closes along
        this main thoroughfare. We navigated between buskers and tourists. Past the parliament building and finally into Holyrood Park. The volcanic and glacial geographic formations jutted into the sky, reconstructing the horizon.</p>

    <p>Ever looming with grey precipitation the clouds migrated about a bright, blue sky. This brightness matched the hillside adorned in the late May colors of green grass and yellow gorse flowers. The ascending hike past the Salisbury Crags inspired rock
        climbing aspirations. Prohibited without a permit however, I only saw one person daring the climb. The trek up was enough of an endeavor anyway.</p>

    <p>Past the crags a valley led us to another steep ascent towards Arthur’s Seat. The rain spared us but the wind increased with the altitude. A small rolling hill of green greeted us before the final ascent up the narrow paths to the rocky peak. The
        path up only allowed enough space for one traveler at a time to pass. Patience was necessary with the hillside bustling with hikers. Eventually we arrived at the peak. Looking out for miles over the entire city, from the harbor at Leith to the
        surrounding neighborhoods and hills. All the while the wind tried tossing us from the crag into the distant landscape.</p>

    <p>At the peak I had a brief conversation with a fellow from the Orkneys. We started conversing about another tourist taking the same picture of herself at the top of the hill. It turned out we shared common tastes in music and discussed different performing
        acts witnessed over the years. He gave me some hints to hunting LP’s in Scotland before we parted ways.</p>

    <p>My mother and I decided to descend the opposite side of the hill, towards Leith and the Firth of Forth. The ruins of an abbey overlooking a loch were our next destination. We split up for the first descent. I took the steeper path while my mother
        took an easier route. After a few steps downward I noticed a crow perched on a rock inspecting a single black feather. The bird and I watched one another briefly before it picked up the feather and flew off from the rock.</p>

    <p class="mb-xl-5">Crows represents change, balance and opportunity within Pagan beliefs. At the time I wasn’t sure what to make of this encounter, but it did not seem a harbinger of ill fate. Jasmine and her mother also share this bird as a spirit animal. So I smiled
        and followed the bird down towards the path to meet my mother. Reconnecting, we trekked down the steep hill towards the ruins of a small abbey. We rested upon arrival, looked out over the loch to the Firth of Fourth beyond.</p>

    <p>Heading around the bottom bend we arrived at the entrance of Holyrood Park where we began our hike. Stopping at the gates of Holyrood Palace we watched the guards change position only to freeze again at their next post. Hungry and worn out we didn’t
        stay long enough to watch another changing of the gaurd. Instead we headed back up the Royal Mile to my sister’s flat. This gave us time to recuperate from the hike, check in back home and change for our next outing, dinner.</p>

    <p>Our group eventually agreed on my vote of Indian cuisine. We made note of Namaste Cafe the day before while walking to Greyfriars Kirkyard and made it our destination for the evening. A short walk later and the host seated us at a table. The first
        to arrive for dinner hours, we had the entire restaurant to ourselves.</p>

    <p>After the naan and saag we strolled a few doors down for a drink at Sandy Bell’s. A traditional folk band sat at a table in the back room, plucking their strings as the crowded pub hummed around them. Finishing our drinks quickly we left for more
        open spaces, through the University of Edinburgh’s campus.</p>

    <p>Emily showed us the outside of the bone lab building where she spent most of her time. She pointed out the slender and barred windows, referring to the building as the Bone Dungeon. Campus ended at a large grassy field, The Meadows. We walked along
        the pathways with overhanging limbs from freshly blossoming Elms. Along the edge of the park the campus buildings alternated between modern and archaic architecture. We took the short route through the park back to the streets. Continuing beneath
        the castle on the side opposite to Princess Street Gardens. Walking towards the gate where the Royal Mile begins we noticed the large hedge of lilacs blooming just on the other side of the street’s retaining wall. The smell of the fresh, purple
        blooms juxtaposed the smell of the wet, stone-workings of the old city. As the sun began its descent towards the horizon we crested the street’s and noticed a rainbow arching across our path through the sky. Another good omen for our travels.</p>

    <p>Finally returning to Emily’s flat after such a long day of walking was a relief. My leg muscles ached, unaccustomed to the steep terrains. Still, there was no rest for the weary. The next day we left early on a train to Aberdeen. This east coast city
        was the next step in our tour across Scotland. So, we packed our bag,s leaving any unessentials in the dorm. We connected with my father at home before laying down to sleep.</p>
