    <p>Pentland Hotel offered a Scottish breakfast on the first floor and sack lunches for Orkney tourists. A front desk concierge handed us our lunches then we bounded out to catch our taxi to Scrabster. The cabbie took a single left turn to take us from
        Thurso to Scrabster. On the way we discussed our heritage with the driver. He recognized the Shanks name from the Armitage Shanks brand of bathroom fixtures. Yet, still didn’t recognize it as Scottish and guessed it of English or Irish descent.
        We laughed as everyone else we asked on the trip said something similar. The Scottish said we were English, the English said we were Irish and the Irish pointed back toward Scotland. Still a mystery what heinous action justified the expulsion
        of Shanks from history. We paid our driver, thanked him for the ancestry lesson then ran to catch the ferry.</p>

    <p>The NorthLink ferry was huge and offered excess amenities for the ninety minute ride across the Atlantic. Emily took some medicine to avoid motion sickness and slept the majority of the voyage. I bought a coffee from the bar and met my mom out on
        the rear deck. We watched the waves crash against the hull as mainland Scotland slowly sank away into the mists. Brisk winds pushed the exhaust from the engine over the back deck. We returned to the interior to avoid the chill, noxious fumes and
        wait for the boat to pass The Old Man of Hoy.</p>

    <p>After walking around the upper deck for the next hour I felt victorious in conquering my proneness to motion sickness. An announcement came over the intercom informing passengers of the quickly approaching landmark. My mother and I pulled up our hoods
        before stepping back out into the cold. Fog thickly wrapped itself around the crags, up high rolling hills of green. The Old Man of Hoy stood away from the island cliffs, a tower of rock rising alone from the cold ocean waves. The first person
        to climb the sea stack of basalt and red sandstone celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the event by repeating the feat at the age of eighty. A scout apparently climbed the tower at the age of nine…or maybe it was ten. The age didn’t matter
        much to me, impressed anyone would attempt the climb.</p>

    <p>Fifteen minutes past The Old Man of Hoy we made land in Stromness Harbor. Our tour guide; Clive, arrived shortly after and our small group loaded into his fifteen seater van. An older Australian couple on holiday were the only other guests. They sat
        in the middle bench seat while my sister sat up front with the guide to avoid motion sickness and ask plenty of historical questions. Confident the voyage hadn’t bothered my inner ear I sat in the back with my mother. Within the first five minutes
        of driving off into the sprawling land of Orkney I quickly realized I wasn’t cured of motion sickness.</p>

    <p>“If you look to the left you’ll see this particular landmark… If you look to your right you’ll see this particular landmark…”</p>

    <p>Acquiring details became challenging as nausea and disorientation took over. Thankfully, I was able to make it to our first stop without regurgitating breakfast, St. Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. Ceramic, red poppies adorned the cathedral’s main entrance.
        A traveling art installation honoring fallen soldiers from the first world war. Walking beneath the vaulted ceilings I was grateful for firm ground beneath my feet.</p>

    <p>However, respite was short-lived, we quickly returned to Clive’s van. Retrieving the banana from my sack lunch I gulped down the fruit in hopes of settling my stomach. To avoid further discomfort on the road I moved to the middle bench seat with the
        older, Australian couple on holiday. Unfortunately this helped little. The van rolled along the bumpy city streets as the guide rounded sharp corners. I pressed against pressure points in my wrists to alleviate the nausea. Crackling over the radio,
        Clive’s voice continued explaining surrounding landmarks. Tranced, the minutes and miles passed with closed eyes. Trying my best not to vomit all over the interior of Clive’s van and the nice couple beside me. Eventually the rolling hills gave
        way to our next stop. Crossing a submarine barrier from the second world war brought us to the site of The Italian Chapel.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Saint George and The Dragon</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Italian prisoners of war built the chapel. Their work was ornate despite the sparse materials provided to them. Most impressive were the masterful paintings of the interior. Details remain fuzzy as I continued trying to regain balance amidst the murals.
        Returning outside the group briefly viewed the statue of Saint George atop a horse, charging a dragon with his spear. Again, the fresh air helped but respite was short. Back into the van, onto the winding, hilly roads that challenged my resistance
        to regurgitate. Our next stop was the neolithic settlement Skara Brae. It was a fair distance from the chapel, I believe I rested beside the Australians briefly during this trip.</p>

    <p>Awakening from my trance as the van pulled to a stop and unloaded. Again, I followed the group around the site in a dazed, nauseated state. Happy to stretch my legs outside the van. Skara Brae sits on the coast of the Atlantic. It remained undiscovered
        until a violent storm ripped up the dunes revealing the neolithic stone village below the sands. Erosion constantly threatens the site. We walked around the small stone huts, my sister persisted with adept historical questions prompting Clive
        explain minute, historical details. I tried reasoning that my disorientation was caused by this ancient history merging with our present dimension… Delusional episodes were a symptom I had yet to encounter in my many experiences with motion sickness.</p>

    <p>The Skaill House hosted a museum exhibiting artifacts from previous owners. We carefully made our way through old possessions, safely sealed behind glass or roped off beyond the grasp of patrons. After making our way through the house it was time
        for lunch.
    </p>

    <p>Mom, Emily and I chose a picnic table outside. We quickly ate our sandwiches and chips, washing lunch down with Irn Bru soda. Mom stepped inside the gift shop to find souvenirs for friends while Emily and I hurried back to the van. Waiting outside
        the van for the rest of our group Clive answered Emily’s questions while I continued digesting and deeply inhaling the ocean breeze.</p>

    <p>I sat up front with my sister and Clive on our way to the Yesnaby Cliffs. A full stomach mitigated nausea, but the countryside roads persisted. Fortunately the cliffs were a short distance from Skara Brae and the other sites remaining on the tour.</p>

    <p>Yesnaby jutted over crashing waves far below. Our mother made us promise not to near the edge. Clive reinforced the advice noting the cliffs as un-sturdy overhangs with a long drop into the Atlantic. Endemic Scottish Primrose bloomed later in the
        year, instead of searching for the small, purple flower in the surrounding fields we returned to the van. With the history lesson for the cliffs finished we headed for the next two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones
        of Sterness.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Mother Stone</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Both rings of standing stones are older than Stone Henge. The Ring of Brodgar hosted many unique stones including the Mother Stone, famed for a purple aura, easily spotted by those with the proper sight. Our small group processioned along the ring
        of stones as the tour busses began to pull up and unload. As we exited the path the large bus groups started making their way past us towards the stones. Clive encouraged staying ahead of the busses.</p>

    <p>As we pulled into park at the Stones of Sterness Clive pointed out some seals sunbathing in the loch across from the site. Sterness hosted fewer stones than Brodgar but their immense size towered above any in Brodgar. They stood in the middle of a
        field, still used by the current farmer for corralling sheep. Clive told us more stones used to stand in the field but a previous owner was disgruntled by the growing masses of tourists scaring his livestock. His solution was using dynamite,.
        He targeted the stone known as The Healing Stone. It had a hole large enough to pass an infant through. Believers passed an afflicted body part through the hole to alleviate ailments. The disgruntled farmer utilized this weak point, filling the
        hole with explosives. Perturbed by their neighbors demolition the locals placed the farmers head through the hole of a noose… perhaps he was sent adrift… then again the locals might have just run him out of town, Clive wasn’t very clear on the
        matter or I remained dazed by nausea.</p>

    <p>With these final two sites visited the tour concluded. Clive zipped along the roads back towards Stromness Harbor. His voice still coming through the radio from his headset. He pointed out new and previously seen landmarks nearing Scrabster. Back
        at the docks we unloaded, tipped Clive and boarded the huge NorthLink vessel. Upstairs we found a large enough bench for my lanky body to sprawl across. The server at Mum’s told us to lay on our back if we felt sea sick. I did just that for the
        entire ride back to the Scrabster.</p>

    <p>Awakening from a nap I felt at my worst as NorthLink docked. Exiting the bobbing vessel onto solid ground again I realized my significant imbalances. The solid concrete mimicked the ocean’s movement. Fearing I might concede my intestinal contents
        I wobbled to the nearest bathroom. Resisting the urge to vomit I tried regaining my balance in a stall. There was little I could do to help. Eventually stumbling out of the bathroom, I managed to limp to our awaiting taxi outside. In the front
        seat I held my head in my hands begging relief from the nausea. Returning to the hotel seemed to take longer than leaving it this morning. Mother finished paying for the taxi as I grabbed the room key and limped up the flights of stairs to our
        room. Opening the door I rushed to the bathroom. Fighting regurgitation, I sat in the tub, hot water showered the crown of my head and ran down my spine. This method remedied my condition best. When the hot water ran out I dried and dressed. My
        mother and sister brought ginger ale to the room. It eased my stomach allowing me to eat some cheese and grapes.</p>

    <p>After checking in with Dad back in the states I was finally feel well enough to head back into the world. Despite my unstable stomach I decided we should enjoy seafood at The Pavillion. A small, charming, beachfront restaurant. A plate of shrimp with
        a side of chips was all I was able to digest. Leaving The Pavilion the beach welcomed us with a setting sun. Lighting the sky with multicolored hues. Thurso’s old, stone buildings superimposed over the technicolor backdrop of ocean and sky.</p>

    <p>Sleeping in the cramped bottom bunk the night before resulted in agitated neck muscles, which likely worsened my motion sickness. So, I ripped the bedding from the two mattresses and made sleeping arrangements on the floor. Saying goodnight, I turned
        off the lights and curled up on the floor-bound comforters. Staring up at the small, wall mounted television, I scanned through channels until settling for a terrible super hero movie. I nestled further into sleep, hoping what remained of my imbalance
        to dissipate overnight.</p>
