    <p>I hardly slept, anxious about missing boarding times or engineering malfunctions mid-flight. Groggily we gathered our bags with a digital alarm sounding. Then hurriedly checked out of the hotel skipping the complimentary breakfast. Walking back to
        the airport through the parking lots with the early light of morning dispersing fog banks. Arriving where the bus dropped us off last night, we entered the airport and quickly checked in for our flight. This time without any problems. Just a quick
        scan of our passports and we were ready. An escalator brought us up a floor where we departed from my sister to pass through security and customs. We hugged her goodbye before she took a picture of our tired faces. She left to catch a train back
        to Edinburgh while we walked the queues of the duty free shop to our first gate. We got coffee on the way and waited for boarding.</p>


    <p>Our flight back wasn’t quite as exquisite as our flight over in the Virgin Atlantic airship. No second deck or complimentary meal, just a single aisle with two rows of seats on either side. A longer trip on a smaller plane allowed for the turbulence
        to increase as we traveled against the trade winds and time zones. I tried ignoring the bumps while writing down a first draft of this account. The flight attendants brought customs paperwork to the passengers, necessary upon arrival to Halifax.
        Passengers continuing to Toronto would only have a brief window to clear customs and return while the plane refueled. It was a short forty-five minutes which caused anxiety of missing the flight to arise. Acutely experienced, my anxiety heightened
        as I felt the plane drop altitude as the descent into Halifax began. I inhaled sharply and tightly gripped the arm rests with every drop of fifty feet or so until the tires finally met runway tarmac.</p>

    <p>As the plane pulled to a stop at the gate passengers began grabbing their bags from overhead compartments and rushing off the plane. Lining up to claim bags and show customs our paperwork. Each agent read over their prompt of questions, looking over
        the papers each passenger handed over. Confusing some aspect of my paperwork on the flight, the customs agent took a permanent marker drawing a circle in a fat black line around a mistake. She then directed me to the next part of the process with
        a thumb. I met my mother in the next line as the next agent looked over our papers and directed each passenger left or right. My mom got left. When I handed the agent my paperwork with the large, black circle she pointed me right. My mother, still
        waiting for me just beyond the agent’s kiosk looked at me with concern. I sighed as we parted ways, hoping to see her on the other side.</p>

    <p>I stood in line behind another couple from my flight. An agent let them through the black queue ribbon to a station where their bags were checked by another agent. I sighed again, listening to the customs agent rifle through co-passengers luggage.</p>

    <p>He confiscated Haggis from the couple before quickly re-zipping their luggage and sending them on their way. Admitted through the black ribboned queue, I was lead to the table where the agent checked bags. Recognizing a band logo tattooed on the agent’s
        arm I asked him if I was correct in guessing the band. His demeanor lightened a bit. He started talking about meeting the lead singer while working. He asked me a few more questions about my travels then zipped my bag. Happy to have made it through
        the search I rushed down a hallway to find my mother.</p>

    <p>On the way out of customs into the airport I was supposed to recheck my bag for the flight. The attendant re-checking bags near a conveyor belt waved to me jovially, telling me to enjoy my day as I ran past him into the main lobby of the airport with
        my unchecked bag. My mother stood on the other side of the doors in the main lobby of the Halifax airport. She wondered why my bag wasn’t on the conveyor belt heading back to the plane. Befuddled I turned back to look at the door, two attendants
        stood guarding it from entry. They told me to recheck the bag at the check in terminal. With a rushed anxiety we quickly made our way across the lobby to the corresponding ticket counter at the opposite end. Fortunately they were able to retag
        my luggage and place it on the conveyor belt. I hoped to see my clothes in Louisville as it passed through rubber flaps out of sight.</p>

    <p>With this dilemma solved we briskly walked through the airport to wait in a slow moving security queue. Slowly corralled by canvas ribbons and metal posts until passing through the body scanners. We picked up the pace to make up for lost time, almost
        in an all out sprint as we reached our gate. We presented our boarding passes and made it back to our seats with two minutes to spare. The flight attendant went through the safety procedures as the captain prepared for take off. We buckled in
        taking a deep breath as we leaned back into our seats.</p>

    <p>The flight to Toronto was short. Too distracted by the beautiful view of the metropolitan sprawl below the sensation of my stomach dropping lessened as the plane descended. On the ground, passengers rushed to collect bags and queued up again for customs.
        Already grumpy from my first experience I was expecting another random search in Toronto. However, the process was simple and we made it through easily. We explored the massive airport searching for our connecting gate to New York City.</p>

    <p>Making our way through long hallways past areas under major renovations until we found a main lobby. We scanned our passports at one of the many check in kiosks before making our way through another round of security. On our way to our gate we passed
        our options for dinner. We opted for an overpriced deli sandwich instead of the overpriced poutine. At our gate we ate, waiting for the flight to start boarding.</p>

    <p>When the gate attendant called our group for boarding we felt like seasoned travelers handing over our boarding passes. Weary but exited to return home. The plane took flight over Lake Ontario and I settled into my seat trying to find a something
        to watch on the small television screen mounted in the headrest of the seat in front of me. I don’t think I even made it through a full episode of anything before we found ourselves descending into the lights of New York City. I’ve visited the
        Big Apple many times before but this was my first flight into the city and a new way to experience its massive skyline.</p>

    <p>With the aircraft on the ground we made our way through another massive airport expecting to encounter the hassle of customs again. Exhausted and baffled we finally asked someone at a help desk who told us we were all set to board the next flight
        to Louisville. The attendant then directed us to our proper gate just around the corner from his desk.</p>

    <p>Relieved we found an open seat at a table to rest and charged our phones. We turned our service back on for the first time in weeks to let Jasmine and my father know our whereabouts. It was a further relief when we entered the small but sparsely occupied
        cabin. The flight attendant provided snacks and beverages as we found comfort in the seats and awaited our arrival back home.</p>

    <p>After a few hours of flying over sparsely lit Appalachian Mountains our descent into Louisville began. The landmarks of the city greeted me with familiarity as we neared the runway. Before we could even pull into our terminal I was letting Jasmine
        know we’d made it home safely. Exiting the plane we walked through the empty terminals of the airport where we’d started our journey thirteen days earlier. We stood at the conveyor belt waiting for our luggage. A voice over the intercom announced
        our luggage was available at another pick up point. Wheeling our luggage outside we waited on the sidewalk for my father to arrive with Jasmine.</p>

    <p>We gratefully accepted our welcome home hugs when they pulled up. I quickly loaded our bags in the trunk and we left. It only took minutes to arrive back home since Jasmine and I live a few miles away from the airport. I unloaded my bag before hugging
        my mother goodbye, looking for proper words to thank her for such a wonderful trip. She accepted my simple words of thanks before returning to the car so my father could race them home a county over. I relived my travels to Jasmine, showing her
        pictures while fighting sleep. When my phone alerted me to my parents safe arrival home I could finally allow exhaustion to overtake me. Jasmine all but carried me to bed where I closed my eyes and allowed my journey to end.</p>
