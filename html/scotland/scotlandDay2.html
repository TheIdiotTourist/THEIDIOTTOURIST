<h2 class="text-center font-weight-bold"><u>DAY 2 – EDINBURGH</u></h2>

<p>Finally on the ground again I was happy to use my legs and breathe real atmosphere instead of an airplane cabin’s manufactured oxygen. We found our bags on the carousel before making pleasantries with customs agents. They greeted us warmly into the country
    after asking their list of questions. We made our way to the lobby of the airport where I enjoyed my first cup of coffee. It helped as we tried to figure out the proper train tickets for Edinburgh. Travel weariness and unfamiliar technologies match
    poorly. A customer service agent told us to catch a bus from the airport to the train station. Guided outside after buying train tickets we found the bus stop directly past the exit. The next bus arrived and my mother asked the driver if it would
    take us to the proper train station. Helpful, he told her how many stops exactly. She paid for our bus fare and found a seat. I secured our bags on the luggage rack, then found my mother near the back. We counted stops while taking note of landmarks
    for our return to Glasgow at the end of our trip.</p>

<p>Our stop quickly arrived and I encountered my first international faux pas. Pulling the bags from the rack I managed to spill the remaining coffee from my cup all over the shoulder of another passenger’s jacket. Luckily, the gentleman was well prepared
    for Scottish weather and the coffee dripped off the water resistant material. I felt lucky he brusquely accepted my panicked apologies. The awkwardness of the situation prolonged as we both exited the bus and began walking the same direction. City
    blocks passed in uncomfortable silence. The train station finally arrived and I imparted another desperate apology before we bustled beneath the streets. The next train to Edinburgh arrived fifteen minutes later.</p>

<p>Easing into my seat I watched the city quickly disappear as the train sped into the countryside. I looked through the window at rolling hills of green with vast swathes of yellow bushes, dotted intermittently with a farm house or herd of sheep. The train
    stopped at stations in countryside towns, exchanged passengers, then returned to the route. Towns disappeared, replaced by more hills. Many topped with spinning, white, wind turbines.</p>

<p>Eventually, the countryside gave way to suburban sprawl followed shortly after by the city proper. Nearing Waverly Station the architecture revealed the age of Edinburgh. Traveling back in time the closer we got to Old Town. The cliffside jutted upwards
    to the right of the rails. Imposing castle walls mortared ages ago extended the cliffs further into the sky.</p>

<p>As I marveled at this new perspective of history the train came to a stop in Waverly Station. I gathered our bags without incident before exiting to the platform. Our next goal was rendezvousing with my sister, Emily. She waited at the main gates of the
    station near a storefront. Managing to take a lesser used exit, we ended up on the opposite side of the building. Again, feeling like lost reservations we rounded the building only to sneak up on my sister. We greeted with hugs before taking a picture
    to provide evidence for my father of our safe arrival to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Emily guided us up the steep hill of cobblestone streets towards the castle and surrounding buildings, equally archaic. Maneuvering through black cabs and our first five way intersection brought us through stone archways leading to a steep, stone stair
    case. At the top was the courtyard of my sisters flat. Her dorm only a few more flights of stairs to drag our bags before we could stow them away and finally unwind from our flights. The flat my sister shared with two other girls formed a long corridor
    with two bathrooms, one at either end and a shared kitchen directly across from the front door. All the rooms extended from the same side of the corridor and placed every window facing one of The Royal Mile’s busiest intersections. Bagpipers were
    heard most hours of the day as black cabs and double decker busses speed between the large mass of tourists below.</p>

<p>We began unpacking and settling into the small dorm room. Large enough for a desk, armoire, and small bed frame. Fortunately, enough floor space for a queen sized air mattress, used for the duration of our stay. My priority after finding a corner to claim
    for my bags was finding a bathroom. My sister directed me to either end of the hallway.</p>

<p>I went to the furthest bathroom away. This incurred my next faux pas. After washing up I returned to the corridor but in my jet lagged state I didn’t count the correct amount of doors. Instead of returning to my sister’s room I entered the first door
    I came to. The room was occupied by my sister’s sick flat mate; watching television, huddled beneath blankets on her bed. Once again baffled and embarrassed I stuttered an apology, backed out of the room and continued to my sister’s. The rest of my
    trip I did my best to go unseen and unheard despite the flatmate’s little concern for the incident.</p>

<p>After finally settling, Emily insisted we head out to take in some sights. This would preoccupy us from our exhaustion. If we fell asleep before nine that evening adjusting to the drastic difference in timezones would become more difficult. Besides, my
    mom needed a new rain coat. She figured Scotland was the perfect place to find the right jacket.</p>

<p>We exited the building directly onto the main thoroughfare of the Royal Mile, just a short distance beneath the castle gates. Food was the priority before shopping. So, Emily guided us across the old streets, through back closes until we reached another
    main thoroughfare. She will claim saving my life from multiple death inducing crossing infractions, but she underestimates my experience dodging oncoming traffic.</p>

Edinburgh Castle on the Streets

<p>We decided something traditionally Scottish appropriate for our first lunch; haggis. MUM’S was the restaurant of choice and the staff kindly greeted us upon entry. Happy to to introduce us to their version of the dish. Enlightening us to the various methods
    of consumption. With brown sauce or no brown sauce.</p>

<p>Our server noted our American accents and questioned us about our vacation. He offered advice on dealing with sea sickness when he learned our travels would take us North across the Atlantic to the Orkney Isles. Then he left us to our haggis. I made it
    through most of the plate heaped up with mashed potatoes and turnip, topped with the ground, spicy meat. The ingestion of cultural heritage left my travel weary stomach overly satiated. So, the rest of the afternoon was spent with haggis kicking around
    my insides.</p>

<p>Even with my upset gut and the intermittent showers I reveled in the the sights of an old city, all new to me. Dodging other tourists equally distracted by the sights we made our way back to Emily’s flat so she could change shoes. My mother and I waited
    on the street below her window.</p>

        <p>After she returned we took the Royal Mile past the crowds of tourists flocking in and out of souvenir shops and pubs. We took North Bridge to Princess Street in hopes of finding a rain coat among the malls and clothing shops. I mostly just tried
            to keep pace and not take too many obtrusive, touristy photographs. The amount of buskers and street performers was astounding. Giving up on the coat search for the day we passed a Piper and Drum duo I found the most intriguing.</p>

<p>Moving on from shopping, Emily took us to Calton Hill. The wind whipped around us as we hiked around towering monuments. With the Nelson Monument to our right and the massive columns of the National Monument of Scotland behind us we gazed out across the
    city. The Royal Mile descended to the Queen’s Palace of Holyroodhouse, into Holyrood Park where the highest hill jutted above the buildings, Arthur’s Seat. The massive, volcanic creation beckoned. Emily informed us the hike could take quite a while
    so we decided to climb Arthur’s Seat the following day.

<p>We left Calton Hill making our way back to the Princess Street Gardens. Blossoming foliage appeared all the more vibrant beside the Victorian Gothic monument to Sir Walter Scott and the jagged cliff face beneath the castle. Beauty was only mitigated by
    my exhaustion. I fought off sleep walking the pathways around the park. Resting with every opportunity granted, on benches or beside castle ruins. Emily tried motivating us through our exhaustion but finally relented, allowing us to return to her
    flat. Through the gardens back up the same steep hill and staircase from earlier in the day.</p>

Edinburgh Princess Street

<p>Back in her room we video chatted with my father back in the states. My mother and I began sinking into ourselves afterwards. To avoid succumbing to fatigue my sister decided another outing was necessary. Coffee might help us through the remaining hours
    of the evening. Wanting to see where Rowling worked on her famous novels, our group decided to brave the crowd and get a drink from The Elephant Cafe.</p>

<p>With coffee in hand we visited Greyfriars Kirkyard just down the street. Supposedly one of the most haunted cemeteries in the world and a landmark on my list. I attempted a paranormal investigation between sips of my beverage. Nothing supernatural occurred.
    However, I gleaned a bit of history from a passing tour group and whatever knowledge my sister offered about the changing burial rituals of the culture. Details of both wavered as I distractedly took snapshots of interesting grave markers, hoping
    for the appearance of some ghostly remnant. With our rounds through the kirkyard completed, we made our way back to the bustling streets.</p>

<p>Nobody else wanted dinner after our heavy lunch but I wanted falafel from a Che Guevara inspired takeaway restaurant. Delicious and easy to eat while walking back to Emily’s flat. It preoccupied me from my weary muscles and sleep deprived eyes. Managing
    not to run into any other pedestrians as the shadows of the evening quickly lengthened into night.</p>

<p>Back upstairs in Emily’s dorm we checked in with my father and Jasmine before making our way to bed. I found a comfortable location between the springs of the twin mattress and closed my eyes. Little time seemed to pass when the sun warmed my face the
    next morning. Sounds of bagpipes below the open window announced the beginning of a new day.</p>
