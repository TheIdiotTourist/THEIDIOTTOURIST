    <h2 class="text-center font-weight-bold"><u>DAY 4 – ABERDEEN</u></h2>

    <p>The next day I awoke in a fashion similar to the previous morning. Bleary eyed, deprived of immediate coffee with bag pipes announcing another day’s beginning. We quickly ate breakfast and gathered our bags before heading down the many steps from
        Emily’s flat to Waverly Station. I got my caffeine fix at a small cart in the station. Anxious to catch our proper train we arrived early. We patiently waited, drinking our morning beverages at the platform.</p>

    <p>When our train arrived I arranged our luggage on the rack as my mother and sister searched for our seats. The cars lurched forward as we found the tickets reserving our spots. Leaving town the towering cliff side quickly disappeared from view as the
        train sped out of the city, across the Firth of Forth and into the surrounding country. The tracks ran with the coast. Sheer cliff faces and sandy beaches met the vast ocean waves.</p>

    <p>Eventually the coastal landscape and small townships transitioned back into a metropolitan modernity. Stopping in the main station of Aberdeen we departed the train. After a quick consultation with a map we made our way through the granite city towards
        our arranged accommodations. The Roselea Guest House was a short walk from the station. Settling in, we threw our bags into respective corners. Then made an unsuccessful attempt to check in back at home. So, we decided to try again after discovering
        what Aberdeen had to offer. Frances, our host suggested we walk a few blocks up where we could take Union Street all the way to the beach.</p>

    <p>With a provided map of the city’s layout we left the back door of the guest house and headed towards Union Street hoping to find lunch. The pub, Ma Cameron’s was suggested by my mother’s friend; Moira, a previous resident of Aberdeen. Since it was
        a coastal town we decided fish ‘n’ chips an appropriate meal.</p>

    <p>The sun shone brightly providing us uncommon warmth in the late Scottish May. We enjoyed the abnormal weather with the outdoor seating on the second floor of the pub. Despite already knowing our desired lunch we still looked over the menu. Quickly
        deciding before Emily ran in our orders downstairs at the bar. She returned shortly with pints to enjoy while we waited for our fried Haddock. I watched the seagulls fly between the granite buildings, landing on the grey shingles or perching amidst
        the chimneys with the bright blue sky above. The grey of the town made all colors more vibrant. Utilizing this characteristic the citizens tended verdant gardens to juxtapose the ordinance to build all buildings from granite.</p>

    <p>Lunch arrived during my color study. Each piece of fried fish hung well over either side of the plate with sides of fries and peas equally generous. We marveled at the proportions before devouring the food. Although struggling by the end, I managed
        to clean my plate. Following the meal up with the rest of my pint so the fish could swim, I sat back in my chair basking in the sun. Finishing before my mother and sister I decided to pay my share and head back down the street to skulk around
        a record store.
    </p>

    <p>Dwelling in a small basement room there was only the owner and his wall to wall collection. The only remaining cleared space was a rectangular path around tables stacked with assorted vinyl. I flipped through the albums quickly but didn’t find any
        on my list. Once my mother and sister met me in the cramped basement room we headed back to the streets above.</p>

    <p>Continuing towards the ocean we took Jasmine Street which directed us towards the boardwalk. It directed us past a large recreation center. Complete with a huge outdoor obstacle course, a BMX course, indoor climbing walls, gym, dojo and skatepark.
        Awed by its existence I looked back every few paces as we neared the boardwalk amusement park and beachfront.</p>

    <p>The skies grew cloudy as we took in the sights the coast offered. Freighter ships slowly trolled through the cold waters. On the beach two young boys disregarded the chill and ran into the surf wearing only their skivvies. To our right was the lighthouse
        standing against the incoming haar. Behind us the amusement park’s ferris wheel remained motionless. A ghostly boardwalk awaiting prime tourist season.</p>

    <p>Leaving the beach we made our way back towards the recreation center. The skatepark inside sang a siren song, begging me to retire from skateboarding retirement. We entered for a better look and enquiry about equipment rentals. They offered hour long
        sessions with rentals for a reasonable enough price. Knowing I wouldn’t have another opportunity to skate their park the will to ride won out.</p>

    <p>There was forty minutes before the next session so we visited the free park behind the building. It was a community free space made up of paths through grassy dunes. My mother and sister decided to continue their walk among the dunes while I headed
        back for the skate session. After I signed the appropriate waivers and paid my fee they fitted me with a board and helmet. The park was well built. Mellow enough for beginners with more difficult obstacles for experienced skaters to enjoy as well.
        After an eleven year hiatus, I took my time in reacquainting myself with the sport. I was impressed I was able to at least ollie and grind a few ledges without detriment to my body. My endurance wasn’t even up for the full hour however and when
        I noticed my mother and sister sitting in the balcony over the park taking pictures I decided to finish the session early.</p>

    <p>We exited the huge building as a martial arts class started their practice. Heading back towards our guest house we passed through Merecat Crossing with a pagoda at the center. A pedestrian took our picture for my sister before leaving the interestinglandmark.
        Making our way back down Union Street I noticed the resemblance in aesthetics to Bardstown Road back home. Businesses lined the street and surrounding avenues, I searched around trying to find different venues hoping for a chance punk show that
        evening. I discovered an open mic hosted at a pub off a side street. We searched for the pub and another venue but had difficulty finding either.</p>

    <p>Returning to Union Street we continued to the guest house, dinner wasn’t necessary with lunch still filling our digestive tracts. Once back to Roselea House we touched base with home. I did a bit more research online and mapped the open mic pub we
        failedto locate earlier. My mother and sister called it a night but I was enchanted with Aberdeen’s coastal charm and wanted to experience more. I followed the streets back to Union and then found the proper side street for Musa. I opened the
        door to the pub with the sounds of a guitar already twanging. I ordered a drink and found an empty table.</p>

    <p>A multitude of performers were present. Guitar players, poets, even a traditional flute player. When the host announced a short intermission I asked if any spots were still available. He allowed me a slot and I returned to my seat. A gentleman arrivedin
        the bar shortly after carrying a strange dark case I assumed held a musical instrument, potentially another flute. He walked over to the bar, ordered a drink and then looked around the pub with a look of wonder, searching for an open table but
        none remained. I sat close to the bar with three empty seats around, so I offered him the one beside me. He graciously accepted and asked about the event. I explained I knew very little since I wasn’t from the neighborhood. He chuckled noticing
        my foreign accent.
    </p>

    <p>His name was Chris. A pleasant fellow with a good sense of conversation. I asked if he was performing with a gesture towards the black case in his hand. He laughed and explained the case held his snooker cue. This was followed with an attempt to enlighten
        me to the subtle differences between billiards and snooker (they remain unclear). The host eventually announced my name, greeting me to the stage. I was nervous, attemping stand up comedy for the first time as an adult, in a foreign country. Needless
        to say they didn’t laugh very much at my “jokes”, but that’s what I get for going up unprepared. Chris told me I wasn’t so bad after I returned to the table.</p>

    <p>Ricky, the host was just as cordial and struck up a conversation with Chris and I. Another local, Britney joined and the three ended up closing the open mic with a rendition of The Gorillaz song, “Clint Eastwood”. After closing the event we tipped
        our bar tender and the locals invited me to another pub favored by the locals. I followed them down the dark streets. Conversing about our lives, making new friends. This continued over another drink.</p>

    <p>As the hours grew late we all decided it was time to depart. I said my goodbyes and thanked everyone for their generous hospitality. Ricky and I walked up Union Street until the proper cross road appeared to take me back to the guest house. I snuck
        back into Roselea House and upstairs to the room where my sister and mother slept. Turning off the light my mother left on, I crawled into bed and fell asleep.</p>
