    <p>The next morning I awoke accustomed to the sound of bagpipers and bustling tourists below the window. I dressed quickly, finished the last of my English muffins and left the flat to head to Ling Ling massage. I allowed for extra time to grab coffee
        and limp my way back down the hill to New Town. I chose a small breakfast shop near Princess Street. It sat on a corner with large windows around the dining area.</p>

    <p>With an entrance at either side of the restaurant I entered closer to the kitchen. Assuming I had incurred yet another international blunder by entering the backdoor, I asked if I had come in the wrong way. The manager brusquely told me it was fine
        and to find a seat. I was hoping to quickly order a coffee and continue to my appointment, but this was a breakfast restaurant not a coffee house. No baristas worked behind an espresso machine, slinging hot beverages across the counter. Here,
        patrons were expected to sit, and slowly enjoy their morning meal. There were family’s enjoying their meals, an older couple sat across from me with their food, the husband reading a newspaper.</p>

    <p>The assumed owner seemed rushed and upset with her help staff. This made it all the more uncomfortable for me when I only ordered a mocha. Mildly exacerbated the owner took my short order. She brought the beverage in a glass mug flourished with whipped
        cream and a spoon. I should have ordered to go. Drinking the hot beverage as quickly as possible, I then paid and left the store through the main entrance. Stepping back onto the sidewalk, looking across the street, I saw the coffee shop franchise
        we had frequented the most during our trip. I sighed over my poor observance and limped the remaining blocks to Ling Ling massage.</p>

    <p>It was a single room spa inside a multi use office building. My therapist met me in the lobby and took me up the elevators to the room. I asked a few different questions about industry standards and licensing in Scotland. Mostly I just tried to relax
        and allow the soreness of travel to leave my body. An hour passed by quickly but getting up off the table I felt loose and ready to walk the hills of Edinburgh with less of a limp.</p>

    <p>Using the building’s wifi I figured out where to meet my sister and mom on Princess Street. I walked back through the streets full of tourists and shops. I found my mother and sister amidst one of the many bustling businesses. Kilts kept catching
        my eye. I didn’t know which tartan I could claim and I knew I couldn’t afford a proper kilt. So, I settled to find a party kilt in Royal Stewart or the Spirit of Scotland; two tartans anyone of any clan is welcome to wear. Within the many shops
        on Princess Street and the Royal Mile we managed to find one single kilt that fit. It seemed a fortuitous purchase since it was the only Royal Stewart kilt in the city my size.</p>

    <p>Hungry, we decided to run a few errands near campus for Emily and get lunch at Mosque Kitchen. It saddened me to have found it on our last full day in Edinburgh. It would have otherwise been a daily request. We made a few other stops in the neighborhood
        before heading back to the flat to start packing up our belongings.</p>

    <p>Once packed we checked in with the states to let loved ones know of our imminent departure to Glasgow. Then we grabbed our bags making a last check around Emily’s room for any unpacked items. We took her old building's stone staircase down for the
        last time. Then out into the courtyard, down the next long stair case. Our suitcase wheels bumping along the cobblestones as we dragged them behind us. This was our last pass by these old buildings, black taxi cabs and tourists. We took the side
        of the road nearest the Princess Street Gardens and followed the lay of the hill down into Waverly Station.</p>

    <p>Joining my sister and mother in our seats after attending our luggage, the train lurched away from the station, quickly increasing in speed. Edinburgh zipped by our window, the old buildings gave way to more modern architectures before we were back
        out of city into the country hills and townships.</p>

    <p>The crowded train unexpectedly slowed to a stop at a station halfway to Glasgow. A voice came over the intercom informing the passengers that a line was down over the tracks up ahead, we couldn’t move forward until maintenance completed repairs. Many
        passengers grumbled as they started calling corresponding parties to tell them of the predicament. Others tried rallying groups together to share a cab the remaining distance. Others opened the windows on the quickly warming train car. A breeze
        flowed through the cabin, easing the unseasonal heat. The doors opened to allow passengers off onto the platform. I was one of them, waiting in line to use the restroom since the train’s remained unusable when stopped.</p>

    <p>The single bathroom on the platform used an automatic door. Pressing a large button opened the door. Tapping another button inside the bathroom closed and locked the door. A simple enough function but lacking a manual override. I discovered this upon
        trying to leave the bathroom. I pressed the open door button with no result. I scratched my head after a few moments passed. Patiently tried the button once more and waited a few more moments. A dread the train might resume course without me mixed
        with claustrophobia formed panic in my gut. I started repeatedly tapping the open button as well as the emergency button. None of which resulted with success. I stood back from the door taking a well planted step before kicking at it in abject
        failure. As I was preparing for another kick the door suddenly opened with the sound of a vacuum seal releasing. Fresh air and bright light flooded into my urinal scented, florescent tomb. I exited holding a hand in front of my eyes like a recently
        emerged vault dweller. My sister and an attendant stood outside. I stuttered something about the door malfunctioning while wandering back to the train car to take my seat.</p>

    <p>I believe the attendant showed my sister and any other passengers to a bathroom inside the station. She returned to her seat inside the train shortly after and with another fifteen minutes the voice from the speakers above returned. It informed us
        of the completed maintenance, the train would soon leave the station. The remaining passengers entered the cars and took their seats once more. My eye twitched as the train doors closed with the same vacuum seal sound the bathroom door made. Lurching
        forward the train quickly picked up speed and we raced along the rails to Glasgow once more.</p>

    <p>The train arrived in Glasgow Central. We bustled off the car with other passengers, through the turnstiles into the station proper. Emily utilized her phone service to GPS a route to our hotel near the airport. With coordinates to a bus sation we
        stepped outside into the Glasgow evening. Maneuvering our bags along the sidewalk between pedestrians, across down town streets until reaching the bus stop. Taking charge of the luggage I once again placed it on the racks inside the bus. Lurching
        forward the bus began its route through the busy city streets until it reached the airport stop where my mother and I began our adventure in Scotland almost two weeks prior.</p>

    <p>Upon exiting I avoided spilling any coffee on other passengers while retrieving our bags. We walked along intermittent sidewalks and parking garages until arriving at the hotel. Quickly checking in we placed our bags in the room then returned to the
        lobby to order dinner. The front desk agents took orders behind the lobby bar then handed us a number to display on a table of our choosing. The kitchen staff brought out our dinners. We quickly and quietly ate before returning to our room.</p>

    <p>The hotel offered thirty minutes of free internet and we utilized it to contact home. I took a quick shower before finding a comfortable spot on the roll-a-way mattress. It was early to bed and early to rise for the next a day filled with air travel.</p>
