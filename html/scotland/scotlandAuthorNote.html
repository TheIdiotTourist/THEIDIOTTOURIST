    AUTHOR’S NOTE</u></h2>

<p>This is my very long thank you note to my mother and hers for helping me travel Scotland. My mother and I both visited the country in the late spring of 2016. The excursion allowed us to visit my sister who was studying to attain her Masters degree in
    Archeology at the University of Edinburgh. We tried witnessing as much of the country as possible during our quick trip. The only way I knew how to repay such fortunes was by writing about my experiences and sharing them.</p>

<p>While flying back home over the ocean I scribbled a quick recollection of our journey into a small journal. A few weeks later and I started a handwritten draft in the same journal but quickly realized a hand written memoir might be nice but completely
    impractical for the project. I wanted to provide pictures and videos I took during our travels. So, that’s when I drafted a word document. This process took longer than I planned and my recollection of the trip went under many edits. Eventually I
    found the formatting of adding pictures too cumbersome for the program so I decided to try a familiar blog site to host my memoir. Dysfunctional formatting again forced me to opt for other avenues. I finally decided to build an entire site dedicated
    to our journey.</p>

<p>This is my thank you to the very strong and influential women in my life that provided me with the privilege of journeying overseas for the first time. For that experience I am eternally grateful.</p>
