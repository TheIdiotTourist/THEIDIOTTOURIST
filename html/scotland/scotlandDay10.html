    <h2 class="text-center font-weight-bold"><u>DAY 10 – BLACKFORD HILL</u></h2>

    <p>Bagpipes acted as our alarm clock again, the sounds a surprise after a week’s absence. That morning we planned to explore more of Edinburgh. Our trek included the National Museum of Scotland and Blackford Hill. The museum hosted an exhibit about Celtic
        culture. Afterwards Emily wanted to introduce Blackford Hill, a park favored by the locals with an easier hike than Arthur’s Seat.</p>

    <p>Before that excursion we stopped at The Piemaker for coffee and pasties. Then made our way to the National Museum of Scotland nearby. Hosting a massive collection of artifacts, an entire day could easily pass while exploring a single floor. Still
        too early and travel weary to investigate all the details I was happy to simply marvel at the collection on the way to the Celtic exhibit. A glass elevator carried us up, past reconstructed dinosaur skeletons, animal models and cultural artifacts
        from around the world. The elevator doors opened to a walkway over looking The Millennium Clock installation and the visitors bustling below. We made our way across the floor to the Celtic exhibit.</p>

    <p>My mother handed a worker our tickets and he allowed us entry. Behind the doors were artifacts providing a new perspectives on the ancient Celtic culture. Dispersed across Europe from the United Kingdom to Rome. A culture widely shared by the isles
        of Scotland, England and Ireland spreading south past Germany. Their art and tools utilized an adept mathematical understanding and connection with nature. Their jewelry and armor usually adorned with symmetrical representations of plants and
        animals.
    </p>

    <p>My favorite artifact was the beastly carnyx. A wind instrument with a long body and a horn shaped to resemble animal heads like serpents or bores. Used primarily to rouse troops to battle. A video display revealed proper playing technique. It extols
        a single note with a deep, brassy timber.</p>

    <p>Ornately carved golden bowls depicted different scenes of people interacting with their gods and nature. Many centuries old books remained behind protective glass under low light. One opened to a page with John White’s depiction of a Pictish warrior,
        covered in blue tattoos. Beastly faces adorned his shoulders stomach and knees, an owl on his sternum and geometrical shapes flowing between the pieces. White’s warrior boasts a round shield in one hand and a severed head trophy in the other.
        On his belt a curved sword, most likely the tool that procured his trophy. Considering my own Scottish inspired tattoo I hoped for some percentage of Pictish descent.</p>

    <p>Exiting the depths of Celtic history I leaned on the handrail for the balcony overlooking the Millennium Clock. It was a strangely beautiful piece commemorating human suffering through the twentieth century. Carved wooden figures rode cyclical cogs
        in their destitute poses. I was completely engrossed by the installation. My trance only broken by my mother and sister arriving from the gift shop. We briefly explored some other exhibits on the way back to Edinburgh’s streets.</p>

    <p>Ready again for sustenance we decided to visit The Piemaker again. Close by, cheap and offering gluten free options made it the perfect option. Afterwards we searched for a record shop and skateboard shop on my request. There was a record shop down
        the street from The Piemaker but none of the LP’s interested my specific tastes. The skateboard shop we walked to was closed so we decided to move onward with our itinerary that day. We made our way through The Meadows again. The fields of green
        were covered with people sunbathing and enjoying the warm summer weather we brought from Kentucky.</p>

    <p>A long walk through residential neighborhoods brought us down to Blackford Hill’s boundary. We followed a forested path until it split left. A black and white cat rested among some rocks at the split. As we neared the cat quickly left the outcroppings
        of rocks and followed the divergent path. We tried to follow but it snuck into the undergrowth and out of sight.</p>

    <p>Continuing along the path brought us to a large pond. Ducks and swans flocked the waters or nested on shady islands. An egg shaped man with thick lenses in his glasses stood near the water with a loaf of bread. He threw entire pieces of bread into
        the water and waited for the birds to swarm. Then he reach back into the bag and throw another entire piece or two. His face remained expressionless. There was no acknowledgement of the other pedestrians enjoying the park. It was just him, the
        bread and the birds. I smiled and continued around the pond.</p>

    <p>Making our way along the water’s perimeter took us up a steep path through a wooded area toward the Blackford Hill Observatory. Past the observatory the path continued further upward along sunny patches of gorse. Finally reaching the apex of Blackford
        Hill we were rewarded with a new expansive view of the city. Looking across Edinburgh’s neighborhoods back to the castle district where the day started caused the twinge in my knee to conveniently transition from a dull ache to a sharp pain. The
        distance promised an arduous return hike. Instead we all opted to ride a bus back.</p>

    <p>Emily guided us back down Blackford Hill through the sloped neighborhoods reminding me of San Francisco. We arrived at the bus stop and waited for the double decker to arrive. The bus sped off as soon as our coins were deposited, leaving us to grasp
        at hand rails as we found a seat on the empty first floor. Zipping along the roads, through campus towards the Royal Mile. It gave us time to discuss our plans for the evening. Fatigued, Emily decided to stay in with a simple dinner of cheese
        toast. Mom and I would go back out to find something a little more filling but just as convenient. After dinner I planned to meet up with my friend Chris from Aberdeen who came to Edinburgh for a quick visit. We found a different open mic just
        a short ways from my sister’s flat.</p>

    <p>Another mediocre Italian franchise received our patronage that evening. Two plates of lack luster ravioli were eaten before we headed back to Emily’s flat. My mother retired for the evening, the long trip and day hike finally exhausting her.</p>

    <p>I quickly prepped to meet Chris and his Edinburgh friend. A short walk down Johnston Terrace brought me to pub where we planned to meet. We enjoyed a few drinks between us and watched some performers play their songs in a small back room. Chris is
        the type of person who makes friends with anyone willing to talk to him. He struck up a conversation with a group of students traveling abroad. The group was made up of Italians, Germans and Spanish students. Their host was Estonian, she tried
        teaching me the correct pronunciation of her for five minutes before giving up in exasperation. After the show ended and the bar closed we all stood outside on the corner. I imitated varied dialects of the American people to entertain our group.
        My performance had them laughing as they headed off down the opposite street to catch their red eye flight back to their prospective homes.</p>

    <p>Chris, his friend and myself walked a few doors down to order late night kababs. We had to part ways as the orders came out so we bid farewell as we walked our respective paths. The haar had set in thickly before we left the pub. Walking up Johnston
        Terrace I stared at the dense fog wrapping around the castle, distorting any notions of modernity. If not for the gyros I shoved into my mouth I might have conceived of walking into the past.</p>

    <p>Rounding the castle I made my way up through the usually packed streets, eerily empty except for myself and the haar. Through the close entrance to the courtyard of Emily’s building then up the stairs to her quiet flat and into her darkened dorm.
        I was asleep shortly after my head hit the pillow.</p>
