    <p>Pulling myself from the blankets on the floor I slowly dressed and lumbered down stairs meeting my mother and sister for breakfast. Scottish staples again offered by the hotel. Eggs, baked beans, breakfast meat of choice along with fruits, yogurt
        or oatmeal. After filling ourselves we returned to the room to pack bags before checking out. We wheeled them down the flight of stairs, to the front desk then out the rotating doors to the street. A few blocks of dragging our cases before we
        arrived back at the empty train station. This trip was our longest on the tour. A six hour ride, stopping in Aviemore to stretch our legs and eat lunch near the Cairngorms.</p>

    <p>The rails returned to Inverness through the expansive highlands. Massive landscapes dwarfed the unattended, intermittent stations. Nearing Inverness the stops frequency increased until returning the the familiar Inverness. Turnstiles and trains bustled
        with people, a drastic difference to the tempo of Northern Scotland. There was a window between trains so we found coffee and seating for people watching. Our next train to Aviemore arrived with the three of us patiently waiting on the platform.
        We performed the routine of racking luggage and finding seats with ease.</p>

    <p>Scottish hillsides passed outside the train window, increasing in altitude and forming the Cairngorms. Aviemore is nestled away near the National Park. Modern buildings mixed with wood cabin aesthetics. Tourist trap attractions for the kids and shops
        catering to popular outdoor sports. Beautifully snowcapped mountains rose above the tall pines inviting the adventurous spirit to challenge their slopes. We were content with just finding lunch.</p>

    <p>Researching gluten-free friendly restaurants near the station brought us to Mountain Cafe. The lower level hosts a sporting goods shop with the restaurant above. The man behind the register noticed our luggage and offered to store it beneath the staircase
        behind a clothes rack. Thanking him we stood in line on the stairs waiting for an available table.</p>

    <p>A line is a sign of good food. Fortunately the wait was short. A server brought us to corner table with a view of the surrounding mountains. We ordered quickly, not wanting to tempt the time constraints of train routes. Our food arrived and I eagerly
        ate the entirety my sandwich then waited for my mother and sister to finish.</p>

    <p>After paying we returned to the first floor to retrieve our bags from beneath the stairs and thank the attendant behind the counter. Back on the streets we walked towards the train station staring at the mountains forming the horizon. The stroll inspired
        a hopeful return trip to the Cairngorms to better enjoy the national park and test my skills on the slopes.</p>

    <p>Waiting for the train to arrive we noticed an older gentleman who bore a striking resemblance to my mother’s father. Balding with a white beard, wearing a red flannel shirt. We smiled at his memory. He initialized the interest in our Scottish heritage
        but never sought to travel to Scotland. Figuring his ancestors tried so hard to get out, why should he go back. The train finally arrived at the station and we boarded with our luggage once more.</p>

    <p>On the train I watched the landscape slide into different sceneries of green. More fields and mountains sparsely covered in evergreens or yellow Gorse. A final transition between trains took place at a small, underground station. There wasn’t much
        time between departures so we rushed along with our luggage amidst other travelers trying to make the same switch. Fortunately no traveler was left behind. We entered a train car, loaded our luggage and found seats as the train lurched away from
        the station. The greens of the country side eventually gave way to the more metropolitan expanse of Edinburgh’s familiar landmarks. Crossing the Forth Bridge we reentered the old city. Upon its high seat, Edinburgh Castle greeted us as we slowed
        to a stop in Waverly Station.

    <p>Tired, we slowly dragged our rolling luggage behind us up the steep streets and staircase to Emily’s flat. Her small dorm offered a semblance of home which we gladly accepted after our long trip across Scotland.</p>

    <p>Contacting the states we notified my father of our safe return to Edinburgh. Dinner was the next priority on our agenda. My vote for Indian cuisine won again and we made our way to Mother India’s Cafe. The tapas style restaurant provided plenty of
        options for our table to share. Again, I was filled with delight over the saag, naan and other delights. Exhausted and satiated we made our way back to Emily’s flat. The long day of travel was over and we were ready for sleep.</p>
