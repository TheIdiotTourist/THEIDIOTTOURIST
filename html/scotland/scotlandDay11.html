    <p>We attended to our usual rituals the next morning after the bagpipes started. A quick breakfast before heading out the door for a coffee in the train station. Rotating our way through the turnstiles to another platform and boarding a train towards
        Stirling. This was a simple day trip without luggage to store, we just found seats and continued sipping our caffeinated beverages. We raced past the green and yellow hillsides dotted with the small townships, some of the sights seemingly familiar.
        Arriving in Stirling a short hour later we stepped off the train and found our way to the streets. We followed signs up toward Stirling Castle.</p>

    <p>The William Wallace Monument towered out of the fog off in the distant hillsides. Buildings aged centuries nearing the castle at the top of the incline. The walls around the perimeter spread out to the three cliff faces forming a semi-oval with the
        main gate facing the downward slope. Other groups of tourist arrived in growing numbers as we approached the main gate. I waited near a wall as I continued waking up and mom bought tickets for the tour.</p>

    <p>Our group of three gathered at the ramparts where I stood. Attendants scanned our tickets then we met our group and guide at the gate. The grounds of the Stirling Castle are massive and the amount of historical context is enormous. Surviving multiple
        sieges throughout the centuries while hosting Scottish Kings and Queens. This included Mary Queen of Scots which triggered my imitation of a Monty Python sketch the remainder of the day.</p>

    <p>“Are you Mary Queen of Scots?”</p>

    <p>“I am!”</p>


    <p>Our guide brought us from one site of the grounds to the next providing details about the architecture and which lord was responsible for a particular installation. After taking us through the throne room and chapel the guided aspect of the tour was
        finished. We were free to explore the grounds to our liking.</p>

    <p>Exiting the church we made our way across the courtyard to explore the heads and tapestry galleries. The heads are ornately carved wooden busts decorating the ceiling. They depict many historical and mythical figures. Including the royalties of Scotland
        and Hercules; the mythic founder of Scotland. Historical actors provided further information through performance, creating a greater reality to the experience. From the heads we passed through to the tapestry gallery. Inside hung hand made recreations
        of “The Hunt of the Unicorn”. A historical actor provided an art history lesson revealing the story of the tapestries and it’s creation. After the lesson we exited onto the battlements.</p>

    <p>Looking over the edge of the tall castle walls to sheer cliff face forced me to gulp down vertigo. Making some comment about the awful heights I immediately noticed a nearby display depicting a man jumping from the wall dressed in a poorly conceived
        flying suit. The Bird Man of Stirling or Father John Damian crafted a suit to enable him to fly from Stirling’s battlements to France. He landed on Scottish soil below the castle. Still, he survived with only a broken femur. He blamed the failed
        flight on his feather of choice. Engineering a suit of chicken feathers instead of eagle feathers. As a fellow village idiot I felt a kinship with the bird man.</p>

    <p>Exploring the rest of the grounds we took extra care along the slender battlements with long falls to either side. Wide enough for a single passerby. Views stretching miles provided prime defensive positioning for the castle. The battlements brought
        us to a grassy, hilled courtyard with a small building near a patch of Gorse. Inside a gallery explained the process of recreating the unicorn tapestries. Witnessing the tedious work initiated our appetites so we decided to follow the instinct.</p>

    <p>We ate lunch at the cafe on the grounds before we making our away to any attractions yet unseen. A few quick stops at gift shops for souvenirs to gift upon our return to the states. Content with our tour we decided to return to Edinburgh. Passing
        through the parking lot and back along the cobblestone sidewalks we passed another historical landmark, Argyle’s Lodging. An impressive, centuries old town-house just down the hill from the castle. Used as a retreat for artists and the upper echelon
        of society mostly. It was another walk into history that presented details of life before modern comforts.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Argyle's Lodging</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>Leaving Argyle’s Lodging we followed the hill down towards the train station. We stood at our platform and waited until the train arrived. On the rails heading back to Edinburgh my mom and sister discussed The Kelpies sculptures located in Falkirk,
        about halfway between Stirling and Edinburgh. Falkirk station was a block away from a bus stop that would take us where the statues stood thirty meters high. However, the next bus running The Kelpies route wouldn’t arrive until after closing hours.
        With this realization we walked the block back to the train station and boarded another train heading to Edinburgh. The train started along the rails and I sat with my back to the engine car while my sister and mother sat across from me facing
        forward looking slightly defeated. As the train sped through the brick buildings of Falkirk into the surrounding hillsides my mother mentioned her disappointment in not having seen The Kelpies. Looking from my mothers disappointed face out the
        train window behind her I noticed the shapes of massive horse heads appear on the horizon. They towered over Falkirk’s buildings. I pointed at the sculptures, telling the other two in my party to turn around if they still wanted a chance to see
        The Kelpies.</p>

    <p>My mother and sister both turned their heads as a grove of trees near the track blocked the view. The blur of green cleared from the train window and the gigantic, metal horse heads came back into view. We watched until the monument faded into the
        horizon.
    </p>

    <p>The train came to a stop in Waverly Station once again. Making the steep hike back to Emily’s flat to rest. We checked in on dad and Jasmine back in the states. Knee still aching from taut, over-hiked muscles, I hoped a massage might remedy my pain.
        So, I started researching Edinburgh’s massage therapy business. Ling Ling Massage offered an unfamiliar modality by the same namesake. A few quick emails confirmed an appointment with the owner the following morning. We decided to dine near the
        spa for dinner so I would know where to go. Down the hill past Princess Street Gardens and further past Rose Street until we found the correct building. With landmarks and directions noted we set off to find dinner. Turning back towards Princess
        Street we walked yet unexplored streets but remained indecisive about a restaurant.</p>

    <p>Rose Street welcomed us as a pedestrian friendly row of businesses. Our brunch at Pattisserie Vallerie was enjoyable so we set out to find another Rose Street restaurant. The Black Rose had dive bar aesthetics with records and horror decorations adorning
        the walls. Fake skulls and real liquor bottles on the shelves behind the bar. A band set up their equipment in the corner for a gig later that evening. I felt right at home. The menu catered to all of our likes and needs. I opted for vegetarian
        bangers and mash. There’s great satisfaction from such staple dishes, I even enjoyed an Irn Bru and Jäeger which matched the meal surprisingly well. Filled, we returned to Rose Street.</p>

    <p>Night was quickly approaching but we found a clothing store still open. Detouring inside my mother hoped to find a scarf to bring home as a gift. She matched her prices but decided to sleep on it, she could return the next day, our last one in Edinburgh.</p>

    <p>Making our way outside as the last fleeting colors of twilight melted into night sky we walked back up the hill to Emily’s flat. Exhausted and close to the end of our travels we all collapsed into bed and fell asleep early.</p>
