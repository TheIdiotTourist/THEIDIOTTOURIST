    <h2 class="text-center font-weight-bold"><u>DAY 5 – INVERNESS</u></h2>

    <p>I awoke a bit later than my mom or sister. Already showered and dressed they told me breakfast was offered downstairs. This got me out of bed quickly, I dressed to enjoy the homemade Scottish breakfast Frances prepared. Eggs, choice of meat, baked
        beans, mushrooms and scone. Thanking Frances before returning upstairs for a quick shower. Afterwards we gathered our bags, bid farewell to our gracious host and left for the train station. I arrived in Aberdeen without expectations and departed
        with a sense of belonging.</p>

    <p>We bought caffeinated beverages at the train station. Finding our departing platform didn’t take long and the train arrived before we could finish our drinks. I carted our luggage onto the racks as my traveling companions found our seats like the
        previous morning. Despite my longing to stay in Aberdeen my excitement was greater for our next stop, Inverness. It was my requested destination while planning our tour of the country. Since childhood I’ve found the legends surrounding Loch Ness
        fascinating. I contemplated the dark waters I’d only read about as the hills outside the train window reached up towards a brooding sky, threatening rain. Dense clouds intensified the shadows amidst the evergreen thickets growing beside the railroad
        tracks and up across the ever-taller crags. Mom spotted a fox and Emily discussed the difference in North American and European deer species. I completely missed the wildlife, distracted by the landscape’s appeal to new perceptions of magnitude.</p>

    <p>The heights passed, conjuring scenery from folk lore. The small towns and corresponding stops increased until we reached the Inverness station. Gathering the bags we hurried out the station into the city proper. The map indicated our guest house was
        over the River Ness, directly across from the city council chambers. After checking in we unloaded our bags into the room hosting us the next two nights. We left directly after to explore the city.</p>

    <p>We made our way back across the River Ness on the main bridge. I watched the dark waters rush beneath us from the loch to the ocean, amazed by the shallow depth through the city. Directly across the bridge we stopped at the visitors center. We booked
        reservations for a loch tour the following day. Searching for souvenirs or tartans relating to the Shanks name was a fruitless endeavor. We hoped one of the other tartan shops might provide a souvenir with our clan name. Other sites took priority
        over our clan research.</p>

    <p>Hootananny was first on the list. A pub offering traditional live music every night on the bottom floor and a larger venue for contemporary acts above. Nobody had interest in pub fare but we knew where to return for folk music. A few blocks further
        and we discovered Nourish, a vegan cafe within a health and wellness center. After our heavy meals of haggis and haddock we decided to try something lighter.</p>

    <p>We were warmly greeted by the owner and head chef behind the counter when we entered. The menu offered nutritious soups and sandwiches. Everyone quickly found an appetizing order which was promptly prepared and served. We each tried a bite of the
        other’s dish and found everything appetizing. Complimenting the chef mom recognized her German accent. They reminisced to one another about their times spent in the country. We finished and paid then left to further explore.</p>

    <p>With assorted shops on every street we window shopped and made note of enticing restaurants. A twinge in my left knee slowly grew into the ache of an enflamed ligament as we traversed the blocks back to the hotel. By the time we crossed back over
        the river I was limping. I wasn’t well accustomed to the long hikes like my mother and sister, returning from skateboarding retirement the day before probably didn’t help.</p>

    <p>The concierge brought me ice and I rested briefly in the hotel room while we used the internet to connect with the states. Ice eased the pain and we rested long enough for most of the cubes to melt. Then decided to head back to Hootananny for the
        music. Exiting the guest house as the sun started to ease behind the horizon, we walked with the river back towards Ness Bridge and crossed again.</p>

    <p>Back at Hootananny we found the kitchen closed and no sign of a traditional folk band. Rather than wait for the music we decided to return the next night. We left for the streets to debate menus posted on the exterior walls of restaurants. After walking
        blocks we finally agreed on a chain Italian restaurant offering Gluten free options for my sister. The food was filling and the waiter offered authenticity as a native Italian speaker.</p>

    <p>Taking pedestrian bridge back across the flowing water, it swayed at the force of our feet. The bridge brought us a few blocks away from the guest house but we detoured to admire the blossoming trees outside St. Andrews Cathedral. Even with a bad
        knee and resulting limp I enjoyed Inverness immensely. Arriving back to the room our hotel beds welcomed us with comfort. I hoped enough rest would resolve the knee pain by the time we started our search for the Loch Ness Monster the following
        day.
