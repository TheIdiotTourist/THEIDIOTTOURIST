    <p>We awoke early the next morning to eat in the guest house cafeteria. The continental breakfast didn’t quite compare with France’s homemade cooking, but the buffet offered larger proportions to fuel the excursion on the loch. Filled, we gathered our
        company and found our way to the bus station. Inside I bought another coffee which led to the my first encounter with paying for the privilege of a bathroom. Instead of blundering my way through this experience I actually helped other tourists
        figure out the correct coins for the turnstiles.</p>

    <p>After managing to avoid another international faux pas I sat in the plastic, blue seats of the bus station eagerly waiting to board. When finally allowed to enter the bus we were some of the first in line. The driver took our tickets and we found
        seats near the front. As the driver took more tickets she asked entering passengers where they were visiting from. A poll she continued over the intercom after we were all boarded and seated. She kept a well trained foot on the gas pedal as she
        navigated our large tour bus across the Ness Bridge and out of town.</p>

    <p>The bus zipped around roads with the loch to the left. The driver provided information about surrounding landmarks from an intercom system. She pointed out a castle across the loch available for short stays for a hefty sum and other details of the
        country side. We soon arrived to the main aspect of the tour, a ferry across the Loch to the iconic Urquhart Castle ruins.</p>

    <p>Unloading at the side of the road, the passengers followed the only path past a large statue of Nessie. We continued beneath the road where the path ran along a mountain stream. At the end of the path our group gathered on a large, wooden dock over
        the cold loch. The ferry to approached with bagpipes blaring over the speakers. Everyone boarded the vessel. Many took shelter from the cold inside the heated lower deck. Tightening my scarf around my neck, I headed for the top deck. There, I
        looked over the railing at the frigid, inky waters below. Wondering if a reclusive monster enjoyed the sounds of bagpipes and tourists loudly bustling above. Massive hillsides towered above the loch. The glacial valley sloped downward, beneath
        the waves forming the loch’s extreme depths. The boat’s wake spread across the dark waters, we continued towards the ruins in the foggy distance.</p>

    <p>Passengers atop the upper deck braved chill winds whipped off the loch. Photographers trying to capture the mystical beauty of the landscape while others hoped in delusion to glimpse Nessie, I belonged to both categories. Approaching land, the fog
        slowly dispersed revealing Urquhart Castle ruins along the bank. The ruins presented a long awaited sight. A scene I only knew from investigative documentary footage or pictures in books discussing the loch’s legendary inhabitant. After docking
        we were free to explore the ruins at our leisure for an hour.</p>

    <p>Our large tour group dispersed. Emily and my mother took their own pace around old stone towers and ramparts. . My knee remained contentious, so I avoided crowds while exploring the ruins. Gathering historical information between long glances at the
        loch out of stone framed windows. Hoping to catch a fleeting moment proving Nessie’s existence.</p>

    <p>I limped up the steep staircase of the main tower. Pausing for any descending tourists to pass me on the narrow stoneworks. Eventually reaching the top of the tower I watched over the dark waters below. No shapes resembling a plesiosaur or serpent
        broke the surface. The crowds increased atop the small platform so I descended, limping back down the crowded staircase. My sister was at the bottom. Neither of us knew where our mother had wandered to explore so we decided to stick together.
        We followed the paths to the yet unexplored side of the grounds where the crowd lessened.</p>

    <p>Years prior to conceiving our trip to Scotland I decided to honor my strange, childhood obsession of Nessie with a tattoo. The famously hoaxed “surgeon’s photograph” is permanently inked beneath my belly button. I joke Nessie growls anytime I’m hungry…
        and admit to a disposition of questionable tastes. Still, the opportunity to utilize my moronic sense of wit arose and I had to seize the moment. Striking a pose beside some ruined walls I raised my shirt and jacket to expose my tattoo, hoping
        to use forced perspective so the tattoo resembled the monster surfacing in the real loch behind me. Emily was kind enough to snap a few shots before we returned to exploring the grounds and searching for our mother.</p>

    <p>Checking the clock we realized the bus departed shortly from our predetermined rendezvous point, the parking lot. My sister walked along with a concerned eye to my limp along the path to the gift shop. Inside we finally found our mother. She was about
        to watch an educational film on the ruins. The theatre was already full despite her attempt to save us seats. The next showing was after our bus departed. We shopped for souvenirs while waiting for my mother to exit the theatre. Mom wanted a few
        souvenirs as well, especially the fox scarf she found in the gift shop. Anxious about keeping the bus waiting I decided to go to the parking lot. Avoiding the stairs I took the elevator to the exit. My mother and sister following in their own
        time.
    </p>

    <p>The bus driver asked entering passengers if they saw Nessie. I laughed, telling her I managed to snap a picture of the monster. Surprised, she of course wanted to see the evidence. I grabbed my camera and opened the picture of me revealing my tattoo.
        Taking a close look the driver chuckled. I took my seat and waited for the rest of the tourists to arrive. When all the passengers reloaded the driver repeated the question over the speaker. I raised my hand with a few others. She retorted with,
        “Now we know who’s had too much whiskey today.”</p>

    <p>The crowd laughed. A couple of elderly women sitting across the aisle from me asked if I really witnessed the monster. I smirked and provided them with my evidence. They both laughed upon realizing the joke. We rounded sharp corners, speeding past
        the farmlands of the loch towards the next tour location, The Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition in Drumnadrochit.</p>

    <p>A small town nestled into the hills beside the loch. The bus parked at the centre and unloaded. Inside we received the full historical overview of the loch and its potential to host a legendary beast. Rooms decorated to resemble the loch bed created
        a perfect ambience for the discussion. The exhibition provided a new, profound appreciation for the scientific endeavor of exploring Loch Ness’ ecosystem.</p>

    <p>Our group returned to the bus, the loch expedition coming to an end. The bus sped past fields of Highland Cows (pronounced Heelin Coo). With tongue in cheek our driver revealed proper methods for catching Haggis. She noted the site of a former Pictish
        settlement then discussed her knowledge of the culture and history of the site. Returning to Inverness we took a bridge over the river towards the station. The driver made note of a few more attractions telling everyone about Hootananny.</p>

    <p>After exiting the bus and leaving the station we took our time returning to the guest house. We contacted home, relating to my father all that facts learned on the tour. Breakfast was long gone and we needed lunch. Coming to a decision as a group
        proved difficult again. Most restaurants were closed for dinner prep. The remaining choices were franchises or tourists traps. Taking the pedestrian bridge back across the river we almost risked a buffet. As I opened the door two patrons leaving
        told us not to bother, the food wasn’t worth the cost. Only a few blocks away form Nourish and running low on options we decided to visit the vegan friendly cafe again. We made it just before she closed. She graciously served up another round
        of delicious food which we quickly ate. Hurrying out we thanked her again for her terrific hospitality.</p>

    <p>Leaving the cafe I decided it was time for rest. My knee ached drastically. Stopping at the grocery store near our guest house I bought a bag of ice. Returning to our room I filled a smaller bag with cubes to hopefully reduce the swelling and pain.
        While laid up I searched for potential massage therapists to visit. Mom and Emily, both better prepared for the long walks took a hike through a riverside park. The pictures they returned with showed beautifully tranquil pathways. Budding tree
        limbs arching over the path towards the river. Far more idyllic than the mundane walls of the guest house.</p>

    <p>With a bit of rest I found some minor relief. Enough to at least limp back to Hootananny after my traveling companions returned from their river walk. Since we missed the musical performance the previous night we decided to head back to the venue.
        With better intel from the bus driver we got there early enough to order a drink, grab a seat and wait for the band to arrive. A large wooden table sat in the middle of the room reserved for the musicians. Arriving one at a time, the band tuned
        their instruments before choosing a song at whim. The energy of the room grew with the music. Large groups of people began pouring in and finding a spot to sit and listen or dance and drink. I tried getting video footage of the band so my father
        could later enjoy the music.

    <p>An hour or so passed and we decided to leave for our room. I was hungry and stopped to get some late night grub. At a kabab shop I ordered a veggie pizza. Piping hot, I crammed portions into my mouth as we walked back to the guesthouse. Over the the
        main bridge again with its green and red lights glowing above the dark water. The hotel mattresses welcomed our return and we welcomed sleep.</p>
